## Cosmidex - ðŸ‘½ Alien / Human Integration Assistance (AHIA) App

This app was developed and managed continuously to assist with the inevitable integration between humans and other species of beings that are either of or not of this Earth. (NHI is a common term used to encompass the entirety).

- I wanted to take advantage here of Apple's brand new Liquid Glass designs, utilizing underrated features, such as useable buttons within the tab status bar above the tab selection itself.

- The screens are simple, yet elegant, incorporating a 'favorite' button, and a zoom animation when navigating through your selections, both in and out.

- This app may shift to utilizing an API for storage solutions in the future.
